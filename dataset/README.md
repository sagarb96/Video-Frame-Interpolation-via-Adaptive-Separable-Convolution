# Disclaimer

The **testing set** directory contains frames which are **present in the training set as well**.
This is not due a mistake, but have been done deliberately. 
Due to lack to computation resources on my side, it is not possible to train on a huge dataset. So what I've done
here is to train on the training set and see how it works on one of the training set itself - unorthodox way to evaluate
the performance of the network, but atleast serves as an indicator to see whether it works or not.
